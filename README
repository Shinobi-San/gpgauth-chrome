This folder contains the source for the gpgAuth chrome/chromium extension.

The google webstore URL for the packaged extension is here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinhikmcljjkhnpjmpfkhjgiaacajajm

The directory './plugins/' contains the platform specific NPAPI binary objects that are compiled from the gpgauth-npapi project: https://github.com/gpgauth/gpgauth-npapi

To test the extension, after installing navigate to http://gpgauth.org/tests/head_test.php or the fancier version here: http://gpgauth.org/demo/

To execute functions for testing, go to chrome://extension, enable "Developer Mode" and click on the link "Inspect active views: background.html", after the element inspector pops up, go to the "Console" tab and execute public methods via `plugin.METHOD()`, i.e. "plugin.getKeyList()"
